            <p class="subheader">the experience</p>
            <p>the whole time i couldn't stop saying things like "this is so cool" and yeah it totally was</p>
            <p>it felt actually magical just looking and tapping, there were so many times where i had to move my hands back down because i thought it just wouldn't see them properly</p>
            <br>
            <p>Seeing panoramic photos and the 3Dish videos was insane</p>
            <p>Seeing my hands in immersive mode was so weird</p>
            <p>it was so fast, i used my phone for a moment and there was absolutely no delay</p>
            <br>
            <p>they played a clip of avatar 2 that was neat i guess</p>
            <p>they finished with this apple vision pro experience thing and it, the whole video i wanted to look around at things only to realize that it's only in 180Â°</p>
            <p>unfortunatly that was really all they let me do with the thing, not a lot of free will</p>
            <br>
            <p class="subheader">issues i have with it</p>
            <p>it's $3500, which does not justify buying something like this, they could easily drop the price by not using glass or having the terrible front screen.</p>
            <br>
            <p>it's very uncomfortable, maybe it's just the strap but either way it's not very comfortable, having all the weight on your face, and i only used it for like 30 minutes imagine what watching a whole movie would be like</p>
            <br>
            <p>You look like an idiot, you're the only one seeing whatever you're seeing, and that front display just looks terrible.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="subheader">conclusion</p>
            <p>it's a very cool vr headset but i don't see it having regular use for a while</p>
            <p>10/10</p>
