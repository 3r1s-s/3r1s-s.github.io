            <p class="subheader">The Experience</p>
            <p>The whole time I couldn't stop saying things like "This is so cool," and yeah, it totally was.</p>
            <p>It felt actually magical just looking and tapping. There were so many times when I had to move my hands back down because I thought it just wouldn't see them properly.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Seeing panoramic photos and the 3D-ish videos was insane.</p>
            <p>Seeing my hands in immersive mode was so weird.</p>
            <p>It was so fast; I used my phone for a moment and there was absolutely no delay.</p>
            <br>
            <p>They played a clip of Avatar 2 that was neat, I guess.</p>
            <p>They finished with this Apple Vision Pro experience thing, and throughout the whole video, I wanted to look around at things, only to realize that it's only in 180°.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, that was really all they let me do with the thing— not a lot of free will.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="subheader">Issues I Have With It</p>
            <p>It's $3500, which does not justify buying something like this. They could easily drop the price by not using glass or having the terrible front screen.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It's very uncomfortable. Maybe it's just the strap, but either way, it's not very comfortable having all the weight on your face. I only used it for about 30 minutes; imagine what watching a whole movie would be like.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You look like an idiot. You're the only one seeing whatever you're seeing, and that front display just looks terrible.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="subheader">Conclusion</p>
            <p>It's a very cool VR headset, but I don't see it having regular use for a while.</p>
            <p>10/10</p>
